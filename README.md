This project demonstrates how traditional sales reporting can be transformed into predictive analytics using Power BI.

The dashboard analyzes historical sales data, identifies seasonal patterns, forecasts future sales trends, detects anomalies using AI-powered visuals, and provides strategic business recommendations.

The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making for retail management.
